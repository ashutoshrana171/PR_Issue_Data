Please delete any irrelevant sections before submitting -->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n\r\n`CrossOver`, `CrossAny`, `CrossDir` might be interesting (and quite simple) indicators to implement.\r\n\r\nTulip indicators provides [CrossOver](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators/blob/be18abb13e075ba866898dcc7cb52399603302a6/indicators/crossover.c#L44) ([see doc](https://tulipindicators.org/crossover)), [CrossAny](https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators/blob/be18abb13e075ba866898dcc7cb52399603302a6/indicators/crossany.c#L44-L45) ([see doc](https://tulipindicators.org/crossany))\r\n\r\nand `CrossDir` have been discussed `https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators/issues/103` and implemented in this unmerged PR `https://github.com/TulipCharts/tulipindicators/pull/110`\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n\r\nCurrently user have to do this kind of calculation itself\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Describe how to reproduce the problem. This can be via a failing unit test or a simplified algorithm that reliably demonstrates this issue.  -->\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Include any system specific information, such as OS. -->\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!--- Confirm that you've provided all the required information. -->\r\n<!--- Required fields --->\r\n- [x] I have completely filled out this template\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this issue exists on the current `master` branch\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this is not a duplicate issue by searching [issues](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues)\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs, feature request can delete the line below. -->\r\n- [ ] I have provided detailed steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!--- Template inspired by https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates -->\r\n\r\nAny opinion about such \"indicators\"?\r\nMaybe they have more interrest for vector backtesting?", "comments": []}
