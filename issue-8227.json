Please delete any irrelevant sections before submitting -->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n- Alpaca crypto symbol properties are accurate \r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n- Alpaca crypto brokerage is using coinbase market and it's SPDB properties but alpaca symbol properties are slightly different, it has a smaller lot size for example\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n- Explore using the Alpaca Brokerage Model instance to adjust the symbol properties of the crypto assets to be precise. Maybe we could do this on the `GetBuyingPowerModel` call since we are given the security and it's done once\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs.
