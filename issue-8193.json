Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n\r\nGenerating reference data using Tulip Indicators should be possible (without searching in quite \"hidden\" repository issue/PR...) It should be part a Lean code\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n\r\nA script to generate reference data for indicators using Tulip Indicators is missing in the repository\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n\r\nCreate a script for that purpose inspired by https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/pull/7654#discussion_r1439861390 from @danielsuh05 \r\n\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs.
