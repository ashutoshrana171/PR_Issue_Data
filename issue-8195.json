Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n\r\nSimilar #8193  but about TALib ie generating reference data using TALib indicators should be possible (it will probably help users wanting to implement an indicator which is implemented by TALib but not by Lean).\r\n\r\nhttps://ta-lib.org/functions/\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n\r\nA script to generate reference data for indicators using Talib Indicators is missing in the repository\r\n\r\nSomeone probably have it... but I don't see it in repository looking at https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AQuantConnect%2FLean%20talib&type=code\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n\r\nCreate a script for that purpose... maybe using Python wrapper for TA-Lib https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python\r\n\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Describe how to reproduce the problem. This can be via a failing unit test or a simplified algorithm that reliably demonstrates this issue.  -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs.
