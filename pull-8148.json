The objective is to eliminate the inherent lag associated with all trend following indicators such as averages.\r\n\r\n#### Requires Documentation Change\r\n<!--- Please indicate if these changes will require updates to documentation, and if so, specify what changes are required -->\r\nDoc for this indicator should be created\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\ncomparison with talipp computation of ZLEMA(5) of SPY close prices using include `generate_reference_data_from_talipp.py` Python script\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Refactor (non-breaking change which improves implementation)\r\n- [ ] Performance (non-breaking change which improves performance.
