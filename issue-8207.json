I am sure there are more.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\nWhen I initialize my quantconnect algo to my Binance account, which holds ALTUSDT, it returns the following error:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2024-07-18_at_11 38 17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/041809ad-8339-452c-858b-787513c3b35a)\r\n\r\nWhen I explicitly `add_crypto()` inside the `__initialize__()` constructor, it returns:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2024-07-18_at_11 47 46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e2f510f-3942-44f1-93fb-313ef7af7043)\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nI would expect these trading pairs are supported inside Quantconnect.\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n- short-term: Adding these two tickers to [symbol-properties-database.csv](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/Data/symbol-properties/symbol-properties-database.csv)\r\n- a better solution: is there a way to write a script to pull all trading pairs from Binance and import them in the csv, and then we run it once a day?\r\n\r\nI am happy to investigate this if core dev team is okay with this suggestion and willing to support it.\r\n\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs.
