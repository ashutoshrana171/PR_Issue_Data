The only vs code instructions I see are in a link to a different page off of the main readme. IE the main readme says:\r\n\r\nThis section will cover how to install lean locally for you to use in your environment. Refer to the following readme files for a detailed guide regarding using your local IDE with Lean:\r\n\r\n[VS Code](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/.vscode/readme.md)\r\n[VS](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/blob/master/.vs/readme.md)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the MacOS section of the main readme should probably just contain a link to the vs code instructions. Or the MacOS section of the readme should be deleted. Right now it just serves as a distraction and leads in the wrong direction. Or at the very least the MacOS section could say that using visual studio is a legacy option and recommend the reader goes to the vs code instructions."}]}
