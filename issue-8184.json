Please delete any irrelevant sections before submitting -->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\nSetting `Settings.AutomaticIndicatorWarmUp` to true and using the greek & IV QCAlgorithm indicators helper methods would provide warmed up indicators\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\nThey are currently not being warmed up\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n- Review `WarmUpIndicator` logic, it should allow for multiple symbols for it to work with the greeks, see `IndicatorHistory` maybe we can reuse it's core logic\r\n- `WarmUpIndicator` should use ScaledRaw data normalization mode for option indicators since we need raw data\r\n- IV indicators has a built in underlying historical volatility, causes massive history requests due to it's default value 252 period. We agreed on removing it\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Describe how to reproduce the problem. This can be via a failing unit test or a simplified algorithm that reliably demonstrates this issue.  -->\r\nN/A\r\n#### System Information\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Include any system specific information, such as OS. -->\r\nN/A\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!--- Confirm that you've provided all the required information. -->\r\n<!--- Required fields --->\r\n- [x] I have completely filled out this template\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this issue exists on the current `master` branch\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this is not a duplicate issue by searching [issues](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues)\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs, feature request can delete the line below. -->\r\n- [x] I have provided detailed steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!--- Template inspired by https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates -->", "comments": []}
