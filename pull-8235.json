The key features include:\r\n1. A new command line argument data-downloader-brokerage to specify the brokerage name when using the generic downloader.\r\n2. Default market names based on the security type if the user does not pass the market name as a parameter. For example:\r\n    - `SecurityType == Equity` defaults to `Market = \"USA\"`\r\n    - `SecurityType == Crypto` defaults to `Market = \"Coinbase\"`\r\n    - etc.\r\n\r\n#### Related Issue\r\n<!--- This project only accepts pull requests related to open issues -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a new feature or change, please discuss it in an issue first -->\r\n<!--- If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it with steps to reproduce -->\r\n<!--- Please link to the issue here: -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\nThe motivation behind this implementation is to streamline the process of downloading historical data from different brokerages by creating a generic downloader. This enhancement simplifies the workflow by:\r\n- Reducing the need for multiple specific downloaders for each brokerage.\r\n- Automatically assigning default market names based on the security type, thus reducing manual input and potential errors.\r\n\r\n#### Requires Documentation Change\r\n<!--- Please indicate if these changes will require updates to documentation, and if so, specify what changes are required -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n- **Manual Testing**: Manual testing was conducted by running the command line with various brokerage ([TradeStation](https://github.com/quantconnect/Lean.Brokerages.TradeStation) and [Alpaca](https://github.com/quantConnect/Lean.Brokerages.Alpaca)) names and security types to confirm expected behavior.\r\n- **Manual Testing with [lean-cli](https://github.com/quantConnect/Lean-cli)**: build new docker container with this branch and changes.\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
