Please delete any irrelevant sections before submitting -->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n- `GenerateOptionTickerOSI/ParseOptionTickerOSI` at `SymbolRepresentation` can handle no empty spaces between underlying and expiration date for example: `AAPL240614C00100000`\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n- It current expected `AAPL  240614C00100000`\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\n- Improve implementation to support both formats. Add new unit tests, see existing\r\n- Will allow us to clean up Alpaca symbol mapper by reusing lean helper methods instead  see https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean.Brokerages.Alpaca/blob/master/QuantConnect.AlpacaBrokerage/AlpacaBrokerageSymbolMapper.cs#L48\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs.
