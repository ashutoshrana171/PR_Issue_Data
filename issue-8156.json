Please delete any irrelevant sections before submitting -->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n- See https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/pull/8153, added an error rate relative to the expected value, currently set at 1%, minimum required so that existing test pass, ideally it should be lower\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\nHigh 1% relative error rate\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional. Describe any potential solutions and/or thoughts as to what may be causing the difference between expected and actual behavior. -->\r\nReview indicators which require such a high error rate, determine cause to evaluate potential solutions, could uncover bugs in the indicators\r\n#### Reproducing the Problem\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Describe how to reproduce the problem. This can be via a failing unit test or a simplified algorithm that reliably demonstrates this issue.  -->\r\nN/A\r\n#### System Information\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs. Include any system specific information, such as OS. -->\r\nN/A\r\n#### Checklist\r\n<!--- Confirm that you've provided all the required information. -->\r\n<!--- Required fields --->\r\n- [x] I have completely filled out this template\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this issue exists on the current `master` branch\r\n- [x] I have confirmed that this is not a duplicate issue by searching [issues](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues)\r\n<!--- Required for Bugs, feature request can delete the line below. -->\r\n- [x] I have provided detailed steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!--- Template inspired by https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates -->", "comments": []}
