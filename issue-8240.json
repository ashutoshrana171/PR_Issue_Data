Describe the behavior you expect to see for your case. -->\r\n`self.calculate_order_quantity(self._future.mapped, 1)` returns a quantity that will lead to 100% exposure.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Required. Describe the actual behavior for your case. -->\r\n`self.calculate_order_quantity(self._future.mapped, 1)` returns a quantity that leads to 5000% exposure!\r\n\r\nTo get 100% exposure, I need to manually calculate it with\r\n```\r\nquantity = int(\r\n    self.portfolio.total_portfolio_value \r\n    / data[self._future.mapped].price \r\n    / self._future.symbol_properties.contract_multiplier\r\n)  \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Potential Solution\r\n<!--- Optional.
